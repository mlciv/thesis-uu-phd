% in defining strings, we make use of the following prefixes:
%
% + S: --- general strings
% + O: --- organizations 
% + C: --- conferences
% + L: --- addresses
% + E: --- editors
% + J: --- journals
% + P: --- publishers
%
% for some conferences, there is variation in the book titles, e.g. for shared
% tasks, student research workshops, or software demonstration sessions.  use
% at least a few common suffixes, even though the exact title may vary from
% year to year:
%
% + :S --- student research workshop
% + :T --- short papers
% + :P --- poster session (where not part of the main proceedings volume)
% + :U --- shared task
% + :D --- software demonstration (aka interactive presentation)
