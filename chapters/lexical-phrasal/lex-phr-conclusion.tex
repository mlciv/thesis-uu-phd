\section{Chapter Summary}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In summary, by analyzing the AMR alignments, we show that implicit AMR
anchoring is actually lexical-anchoring based. Thus we propose to
regroup five meaning representations as two groups: lexical-anchoring
and phrasal-anchoring. For lexical anchoring, we suggest to parse DM,
PSD, and AMR in a unified latent-alignment based parsing
framework. Our submission ranked top 1 in AMR sub-task, ranked 6th and
7th in PSD and DM tasks. For phrasal anchoring, by reducing UCCA graph
into a constituent tree-like structure, and then use the span-based
CKY parsing to parse their tree structure, our method would rank 5th
in the original official evaluation results.
