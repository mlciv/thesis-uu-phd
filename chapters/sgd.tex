From early frame-driven dialog system GUS~\citep{bobrow1977gus} to
virtual assistants~(Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant~\etal),
frame-based dialog state tracking has long been studied to meet
various challenges. In particular, how to support an ever-increasing
number of services and APIs spanning multiple domains has been a focal
point in recent years, evidenced by multi-domain dialog
modeling~\citep{budzianowski2018multiwoz,byrne2019taskmaster,
  shah-etal-2018-bootstrapping} and transferable dialog state tracking
to unseen intent/slots~\cite{mrkvsic2017neural,
  wu2019transferable, hosseini2020simple}.

  Ontology for Dialogue State Tracking}
\end{figure}

As shown in~\autoref{fig:label-schema-example}, the intent
classification task is to understand what the user is trying to
accomplish. Booking a flight, Finding a Movie, or booking a
hotel. While the slot filling task to extract the particular slots and
fillers that the user intends the system to understand from their
utterance with respect to their intent. As shown
in~\autoref{fig:label-schema-example}, bolded text is the evidence
for different slot values. For example, ``economic" implies the value
of the slot seat class, and ``June 10" indicates the departure time.

In \autoref{fig:label-schema-example}, two flight services present two
different ontologies for the same domain task of booking a flight. For
the dialogue presented in the center of the figure, the two services
will produce different dialogue states for each user dialogue turn and
request different commands for downsteam information retrieval
components. When there is a new flight booking service, then there
will be new ontology for the new domain. Hence, even if it shares a
lot of overlapping functionalities with the previous two flight services,
we still need to annotate new data for the new service and retraining
the new model on the newly annotated data. Such re-annotating and
retraining on new services are costly.

Recently, \citet{rastogi2019towards} proposed a new paradigm called
schema-guided dialog for transferable dialog state tracking by using
natural language description to define a dynamic set of service
schemata. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:schema-dst}, the primary
motivation is that these descriptions can offer effective knowledge
sharing across different services, e.g., connecting semantically
similar concepts across heterogeneous APIs, thus allowing a unified
model to handle unseen services and APIs. With the publicly available
schema-guided dialog dataset~(\sgdst~henceforward) as a
testbed, they organized a state tracking shared task composed of four subtasks:
intent classfication~(\IC), requested slot identification~(\RSI),
categorical slot labeling~(\CSL), and noncategorical slot
labeling~(\NSL)~\cite{rastogi2020schema}. Many participants achieved
promising performance by exploiting the schema description for dialog
modeling, especially on unseen services.

Despite the novel approach and promising results, current
schema-guided dialog state tracking task only evaluates on a single
dataset with limited variation in schema definition. It is unknown how
this paradigm generalizes to other datasets and other different styles
of descriptions. In this chapter\footnote{This chapter is published in
  my paper~\cite{cao2021schema}}, we focus our investigation on the
study of three aspects in schema-guided dialog state tracking:
\begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
\item schema encoding model architectures
\item supplementary training on intermediate tasks
\item various styles for schema description.
\end{inparaenum}
To make a more general discussion on
the schema-guided dialog state tracking, we perform extensive
empirical studies on both \sgdst~and~\multiwoz~datasets. In summary,
our contributions include:
\begin{itemize}
\item A comparative study
  on schema encoding architectures, suggesting a partial-attention
  encoder for good balance between inference speed and accuracy.
\item An experimental study of supplementary training on
  schema-guided dialog state tracking, via intermediate tasks
  including natural language inference and question answering.
\item An in-depth analysis of different schema description styles on a new
  suite of benchmarking datasets with
  variations in schema description for both \sgdst~and~\multiwoz.
