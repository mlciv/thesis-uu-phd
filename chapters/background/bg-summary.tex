\section{Chapter Summary}
\label{sec:bg:summary}
In this chapter, we first summarized the recent advances in deep
structured prediction for representational formalism,
learning and inference, respectively. For representational formalism,
we introduce graphic model to represent the structural
interdependence, and represent the main assumption of the independent
factorization as two factor graphs
in~\autoref{fig:bg:graphical-model}. Then we overviewed the
development of representation learning methods for natural language,
from feature selection to deep learning based on contextualized
representation learning methods. We also reviewed the recent advances
of MAP inference and Marginal Inference in deep learning.

The second part of this section introduces the background of symbolic
representation for natural language, including the broad-coverage
meaning representations and application-specific
representations. Instead of studying structured prediction for each
linguistic structured prediction tasks separately, based on
independent factorization, we firstly categorize those symbolic
representations according to the anchoring types, summarized
in~\autoref{ssec:bg:summary-broad-coverage}
and~\autoref{ssec:bg:summary-application-rep}. Then based on the
background, in the following chapters, we study the detailed
strategies for independent factorization by exploiting the structural
inductive biases and natural language as inductive biases.
