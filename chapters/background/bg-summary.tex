\section{Chapter Summary}
\label{sec:bg:summary}
In this chapter, we first summarized the recent advances in deep
structured prediction with respect to representational formalism,
learning and inference respectively. For representational formalism,
we introduce graphic model to represent the structural
interdependence, and represent the main assumption of the independent
factorization as two factor graphs
in~\autoref{fig:bg:graphical-model}. Then we overviewed the
development of representation learning methods for natural language,
from feature selection to deep learning based contextualized
representation learning methods. We also reviewd the recent advances
of MAP inference and Marginal Inference in deep learning.

The second part of this section introduces the background on symbolic
representation for natural language including broad-coverage meaning
representations and application-specific representations. Instead of
studying structured prediction for each lingusitic structured
prediction tasks separately, based on independent factorization, we
firstly categorize those symbolic representations according to the
anchoring types, summarized
in~\autoref{ssec:bg:summary-broad-coverage}
and~\autoref{ssec:bg:summary-application-rep}. Then based on the background, in the following
chapters, we study on the detailed strategies for independent factorization by exploiting the structural inductive biases and natural
language as inductive biases.
