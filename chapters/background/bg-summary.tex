\section{Chapter Summary}
\label{sec:bg:summary}
This section introduces the background on symbolic representation for
natural language including broad-coverage meaning representations and
application-specific representations. Then, we also give an overview
of the linguistic structure prediction and recent advances on deep
structured prediction. In this thesis, instead of studying structured
prediction for each lingusitic structured prediction tasks separately,
based on independent factorization, we firstly categorize those
symbolic representations according to the anchoring types. Then in the
following chapters, we study on the structural inductive biases and
natural language as inductive biases for each of them.
