\subsection{Best Models}
\label{ssec:models}
Our goal is to discover the best client and therapist models for the
two tasks.  We identified the following best configurations using $\text{F}_{1}$
score on the development set:
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
\item {\bf Categorization}: For client, the best model does not need any
  word or utterance attention. For the therapist, it uses \GMGRUH
  for word attention and \anchor for utterance attention. We refer
  to these models as $\mathcal{C}_C$ and $\mathcal{C}_T$ respectively
\item {\bf Forecasting}: For both client and  therapist, the best
  model uses no word attention, and uses \self utterance
  attention. We refer to these models as $\mathcal{F}_C$ and
  $\mathcal{F}_T$ respectively.
\end{enumerate}
Here, we show the performance of these models against various
baselines. The appendix gives label-wise precision, recall and $\text{F}_{1}$
scores.


% We compare these models against the other modeling choices below and
% show the impact of hyperparameter choices in \S\ref{sec:analysis}.
