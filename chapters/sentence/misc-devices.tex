\section{Models for MISC Prediction}
\label{sec:snt:devices}

% \vs{General comment: For every section, add a label. I added one
%  above.}

% \vs{Rename the section title to be more descriptive: \eg, ``Modeling
% an Ongoing Dialogue'' or something else}

Modeling the two tasks defined in \S\ref{sec:task} requires
addressing four questions:
\begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
\item How do we encode a dialogue and its utterances?
\item Can we discover discriminative words in each utterance?
\item Can we discover which of the previous utterances are relevant?
\item How do we handle label imbalance in our data?
\end{inparaenum}
%
Many recent advances in % modeling dialogue with
neural networks can
be seen as plug-and-play components. To facilitate the comparative
study of models, we will describe components that address the
above questions.  % Then, we
% will compare the models and their various ablations as a combination
% of these modules in \S\ref{sec:experiments} and \ref{sec:analysis}
% respectively.
%
In the rest of the paper, we will use \textbf{boldfaced} terms to
denote vectors and matrices and \module{small caps} to denote
component names.



% In this section, for better comparative study on modeling
% psychotherapy dialogue our tasks, we first introduce thress
% plug-and-play components to study each of the following questions in
% our tasks. Then for each task, we will describe the best models and
% their ablations by representing it with a combinataion of these
% components in \S\ref{sec:models} and \ref{sec:analysis}.

%
%``some''. Be more concrete. Use a number. Here say ``four''. Also,

% that discusses that question in parenthesis. The subsection titles
%  should use the words from the question. That way, it becomes easy
