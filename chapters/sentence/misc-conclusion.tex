\section{Conclusion}
We addressed the question of providing real-time assistance to
therapists and proposed the tasks of categorizing and forecasting MISC
labels for an ongoing therapy session. By developing a modular family
of neural networks for these tasks, we show that our models outperform several
baselines by a large margin.
%
Extensive analysis shows
that our model can decrease the label confusion compared to previous
work, especially for reflections and rare labels, but also
highlights directions for future work. 

% Ablation studies on history size, word-level and sentence-level
% attention, focal loss and generic or domain-specific embeddings, shows
% how each of them helps in our tasks. What's more, our model trained on
% regular MI sessions with both MI adherent and non-adherent utterances
% can still achieve a recall@3 of 76.9 on selected good MI
% sessions. Hence our model potentially helps for therapist training on
% psychotherapy domain.
