\section{Main Clustering Strategies}
\label{sec:misc:other-clustering}
This section summarizes the existing clustering stategies of MISC
codes as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item \kw{MISC-28:} The original MISC description of
  \citet{miller2003manual} included 28 labels (9 client codes, 19
  therapist codes). However, among them, there are 13 therapist codes
  are too rare to learn an efficient model on predicting them.

\item \kw{MISC-8:} Hence, \citet{can2015dialog} retain 6 original
  codes \FA, \GI, \QUC, \QUO, \REC, \RES, and merge the remaining 13
  rare therapist codes into a single \misc{COU} label.  Furthermore,
  they merge all 9 client codes into a single \misc{CLI} label. In
  total, they have 7 labels for therapists and 1 label for clients.

\item \kw{MISC-15:} Instead, \citet{tanana2016comparison} merge only 8
  of 13 rare labels in therapist codes into a customized label named
  \misc{OTHER}, and then they cluster client codes into 3 labels
  according to the valence of changing, sustaining or being neutral on
  the addictive behavior~\citep{atkins2014scaling}. Hence, in total,
  they have 12 labels for therapists and 3 labels for clients.

\item \kw{MISC-11:} Then \citet{xiao2016behavioral} combine and
  improve above the two clustering strategies~(MISC-8 and MISC-15) by
  splitting all the 13 rare labels according to whether the code
  represents MI-adherent(\MIA) and MI-nonadherent (\MIN). In total,
  they have 8 therapist codes and 3 client codes as shown
  in~\autoref{tbl:bg:misc}~(\autoref{sssec:bg:dialogue-act}). We show
  more details about the original labels in the group \MIA and \MIN
  in~\autoref{tbl:misc_mia_min}~(\autoref{sec:misc:our-clustering}).
\end{itemize}

\section{Details of MISC-11}
\label{sec:misc:our-clustering}
In \kw{MISC-11}, 13 rare labels are grouped into two set: 8 labels
representing MI-adherent(\MIA) and 5 labels representing
MI-nonadherent (\MIN). \autoref{tbl:misc_mia_min} shows in the
distribution of the grouped \MIA and \MIN labels. Compared to the
other labels in~\autoref{tbl:bg:misc}, the grouped \MIA and \MIN are
still relative less frequent. Hence, we use the focal loss to resolve
the label imbalance issue, and improve the overall performance. The
examples in~\autoref{tbl:misc_mia_min} will help to understand the
meanings of the rare labels. For more details about each of the MISC
code, please refer to the latest MISC annotation
guideline~\citep{houck2012motivational}.
