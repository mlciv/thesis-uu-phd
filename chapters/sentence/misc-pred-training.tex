\subsection{Predicting and Training}
\label{ssec:inference_and_training}

From top to the bottom, every component will
produce some of useful representation for inferences in our tasks.
The dialogue encoding vector $\bm{H}_{n}$, as the final of the
unidirectional GRU, it is also the contextual utterance encoding
$\bm{h}_{u_{n}}$ of $u_{n}$. Hence $H_{n}$ can be directly used as a
representaion of $u_{n}$ for classification in annotating tasks, also
can be used as a represention of whole dialogue for forecasting
task. Hence in HGRU setting, we always use $\bm{H}_{n}$ as the base
option as input for inference.

However, for CON skeleton, the final state $C_{n}$ doest not exactly
represent the segement $u_{n}$ in the whole concatnated
dalogue. Hence, we concatenate the hidden state of the start
position~(0) and end position~(T) of $u_{n}$ into
$\bm{v}^{seg}_{n}=[h_{u^{0}_{n}};h_{u^{T}_{n}}]$, which is contextual
utterance encoding in CON mode.

Beside the above $\bm{H}_{n}$ and $\bm{C}_{n}$ contextual utterance
encoding in dialogue level, our components also produced the original
utterance encoding $\bm{v}_{n}$ from utterance encoder.  Whats'more,
in \textbf{CON} mode, we can use history-aware utterance encoding $\bm{v}^{wordatt}_{n}$
While in HGRU, it produced a self-attentive utterance encoding. We
denote it as $\bm{v}^{selfatt}_{n}$.

We summarize the option input encodings for inference
in~\autoref{tbl:inference_options}. There are two ways to scoring withthese
inputs, one is to score the concatenated those vectors together,
denoted as $\text{concat}(A, B)=\text{MLP}([A;B)$; The other one is
scoring each of them first and then add the scores up as the final
scores, such as $\text{add}(A,B)=\text{MLP}(A)+\text{MLP}(B)$.
