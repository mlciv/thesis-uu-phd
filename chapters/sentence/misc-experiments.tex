\section{Experiments}
\label{sec:snt:experiments}

 The original psychotherapy sessions were collected for both clinical trials and Motivational Interviewing dissemination studies including hospital
settings~\cite{roy2014brief}, outpatient
clinics~\cite{baer2009agency}, college alcohol
interventions~\cite{tollison2008questions, neighbors2012randomized,
  lee2013indicated, lee2014randomized}.  All sessions were annotated with the Motivational Interviewing Skills Codes (MISC) \cite{atkins2014scaling}.    We use the train/test split
of \citet{can2015dialog, tanana2016comparison} to give 243 training MI
sessions and 110 testing sessions. We used 24 training sessions for
development.
% ~\footnote{\citet{can2015dialog, tanana2016comparison,
%     xiao2016behavioral} respectively use 111, 109, 101 sessions for
%   testing. After deduplication, we use 110 sessions, which are
%   almost the same with the first two papers.}
As mentioned in \S\ref{sec:background}, all our experiments are
based on the MISC codes grouped by \citet{xiao2016behavioral}.
