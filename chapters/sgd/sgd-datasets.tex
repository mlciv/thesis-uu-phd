\end{table}

To the best of our knowledge, at the time of our study, \sgdst~and
\multiwoz~are the only two publicly available corpus for schema-guided
dialog study. We choose both of them for our study. In this section,
we first introduce these two representative datasets, then we discuss
the generalizibility in domain diversity, function overlapping, data
collecting methods.

\Paragraph{Schema-Guided Dialog Dataset}
\sgdst
dataset~\footnote{\url{https://github.com/google-research-datasets/dstc8-schema-guided-dialogue}}
is especially designed as a test-bed for schema-guided dialog, which
contains well-designed heterogeneous APIs with overlapping
functionalities between services~\cite{rastogi2019towards}. In
DSTC8~\cite{rastogi2020schema}, \sgdst~was introduced as the standard
benchmark dataset for schema-guided dialog research. \sgdst~covers 20
domains, 88 intents, 365 slots.\footnote{Please refer to the original
  paper for more details.} However, previous research are mainly
conducted based on this single dataset and the provided single
description style. In this paper, we further extended this dataset
with other benchmarking description styles as shown in
\S\ref{sec:abl-desc}, and then we perform both homogenous and
hetergenous evalution on it.

\Paragraph{Remixed MultiWOZ 2.2 Dataset}
To eliminate potential bias from the above single \sgdst~dataset, we
further add \multiwoz~\cite{zang-etal-2020-multiwoz} to our study.
%Multi-Domain Wizard-of-Oz dataset was first introduced
%in~\citet{budzianowski2018multiwoz}. With the large-scale fully
%annotated dialog data, it has pushed forward the research on
%multi-domain task-oriendted
%dialog~\cite{kim2019efficient,wu2019transferable,
%  hosseini2020simple}. Then, 
Among various extended versions for MultiWOZ
dataset~\cite[2.0-2.3,][]{budzianowski2018multiwoz,
  eric2020multiwoz,zang-etal-2020-multiwoz,han2020multiwoz} , besides
rectifying the annotation errors, \multiwoz ~also introduced the
schema-guided annotations, which covers 8 domains, 19 intents, 36
slots.  To evaluate performance on seen/unseen services with MultiWOZ,
we remix the \multiwoz~dataset to include as seen services dialogs
related to \textit{restaurant}, \textit{attraction} and \textit{train}
during training, and eliminate slots from other domains/services from
training split.  For dev, we add two new domains {\it hotel} and {\it
  taxi} as unseen services. For test, we add all remaining domains as
unseen, including those that have minimum overlap with seen services,
such as {\it hospital}, {\it police}, {\it bus}. The statistics of
data splits are shown in
Appendix~\ref{ssec:appendices-multiwoz-dataset}. Note that this data
split is different from the previous work on zero-shot MultiWOZ DST
which takes a leave-one-out approach in \citet{wu2019transferable}. By
remixing the data in the way described above, we can evaluate the
zero-shot performance on MultiWOZ in a way largely compatible with
\sgdst.

\Paragraph{Discussion}
First, the two datasets cover diverse domains. \multiwoz~covers
various possible dialogue scenarios ranging from requesting basic
information about attractions through booking a hotel room or
travelling between cities. While \sgdst~covers more domains, such as
`Payments', `Calender', `DoctorServices' and so on.

Second, they include different levels of overlapping
functionalities. \sgdst~allows frequent function overlapping between
multiple services, within the same domain~(e.g. BookOneWayTicket
v.s. BookRoundTripTicket), or across different domains~(BusTicket
v.s. TrainTicket). However, the overlapping in \multiwoz~only exists
across different domains, e.g., `destination', `leaveat' slots for
Taxi and Bus services, `pricerange', `bookday' for Restaurant and
Hotel services.

Third, they are collected by two different approaches which are
commonly used in dialog collecting. \sgdst~is firstly collected by
machine-to-machine self-play~\cite[M2M,][]{shah2018building} with
dialog flows as seeds, then paraphrased by crowd-workers. While
\multiwoz~are human-to-human
dialogs~\cite[H2H,][]{kelley1984iterative}, which are collected with
the Wizard-of-Oz approach.

We summarize the above discussion in Table \ref{tbl:datasets}.  We
believe that results derived from these two representative datasets can
guide future research in schema guided dialog.
