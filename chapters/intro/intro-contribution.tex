\section{Contribuition and Roadmap}
\label{sec:intro-contri}

Our study on linguistic structure prediction covers two sets of tasks,
including broad-coverage meaning representation and
application-specific representations. Our contributions and thesis
outlines can be summarized as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Structural Biases for Cross-framework Meaning Representation Parsing

  For the alignment distribution, we assume it is gumbel distribution, which can be differentiate sampled by gumble sinkhorn operators.


\item Structural Biases for Pschotherapy Dialog Understanding

\item Natural Language as Inductive Biases for Schema-guided Dialog State Tracking

\item Future Work and Other Applications
\item \end{enumerate}
