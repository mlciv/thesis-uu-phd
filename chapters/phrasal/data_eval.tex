\subsection{Dataset and Evaluation}
\label{ssec:data_eval}

For DM, PSD, EDS, we split the training set by taking WSJ section
(00-19) as training, and section 20 as dev set. For other datasets,
when developing and parameter tuning, we use splits with a ratio of
25:1:1. In our submitted model, we did not use multitask learning for
training. Following the unified MRP metrics in the shared tasks, we train our
model based on the development set and finally evaluate on the private
test set.  For more details of the metrics, please refer to the
summarization of the MRP~2019 task~\cite{Oep:Abe:Haj:19},
%After the evaluation, we then try equip the model the Bert, the results shows in Table xx.
