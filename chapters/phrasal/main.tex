\begin{abstract}
  This paper describes the system submission of our team {\it Amazon}
  to the shared task on Cross Framework Meaning Representation
  Parsing~(MRP) at the 2019 Conference for Computational Language
  Learning~(CoNLL). Via extensive analysis of implicit alignments in
  AMR, we recategorize five meaning representations~(MRs) into two
  classes: Lexical-Anchoring and Phrasal-Anchoring. Then we propose a
  unified graph-based parsing framework for the lexical-anchoring MRs,
  and a phrase-structure parsing for one of the phrasal-anchoring MRs,
  UCCA. Our system submission ranked 1st in the AMR subtask, and later
  improvements shows promising results on other frameworks as well.
