\section{Model}
For the two groups of meaning representations defined in
Section~\ref{sec:taxonomy}, in this section, we propose two parsing framework:
a graph-based parsing framework with latent alignment for lexically
anchored MRs, and a minimal span-based CKY parser for one of the phrasally anchored
MRs, UCCA.\footnote{After the CKY parser gets the related phrasal
spans, graph-based parser can also be used to predict the relations
between nodes.}
