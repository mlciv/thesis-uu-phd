Discovering the underlying structure of unstructured text can help
make sense of the rapidly growing textual data. This dissertation studies
helpful inductive biases for designing deep learning models for
natural language structured prediction. Towards generalization over
new, previously unseen data, the search for appropriate inductive
biases is necessary for any machine learning based natural language
processing system. This is also true for deep learning models to
predict complicated combinatory structures.

In this dissertation, we primarily focus on studying deep linguistic
structured prediction via independent factorization. We propose two
kinds of generic inductive biases to enchance the independent
factorization, including Structural Inductive Biases and
Natural Language as Inductive Biases.  We ground our studies on
both broad-coverage linguistic representations and
application-specific representations.

Due to the compositionality of natural language, these language
representations are defined to be compositional structures. We study
structural inductive biases by designing factorization-oriented
learning and reasoning mechanisms at the lexical, phrasal, and
sentential levels. Furthermore, knowledge is often encoded as human
language. Taking unannotated natural language as a source of
supervision, we study task-oriented dialogue state tracking by
describing the intents and their argument slots in natural
language. We offer comparative studies showing how such inductive
biases help generalize to new domains and APIs.

In all cases, based on independent factorization, the experimental
results show our proposed inductive biases achieve competitive
performance for each task. We expect that the structural and natural
language inductive biases studied in this work can potentially help
other linguistic structured prediction tasks via independent
factorization.
